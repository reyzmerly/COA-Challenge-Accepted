Detailed Explanation
HTML

The HTML file (index.html) structures the gallery, including headers, image elements, and descriptive information about each animal. Each gallery item is wrapped in a div with the class gallery-container.
CSS

The CSS file (style.css) styles the gallery to ensure it is visually appealing and responsive. Key points include:

    Responsive Layout: Using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
    Hover Effects: Enhancing interactivity by scaling and blurring images and revealing additional information on hover.

JavaScript

The JavaScript file (script.js) adds interactivity to the gallery items. It includes event listeners for mouseover and mouseout events to apply and remove the hover effects.
